# A different weather report
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:
This website looks like an ordinary weather forecast website. However, there is a twist.

Although any programming language may be used, I decided to stick to Python. Something I learning in the CS50 course and the final project seemed like an execellent way to test my newly accuired skill.

### Homepage
The homepage shows the weather in the approximate location of the user. The data is requested from the free Open Meteo API. The top of the page shows a summary of the current weather and a 24-hour forecast.

Below it a selection of cities around the world is listen showing the current weather at the city's local time. You can click on a city to go to a detailed weather page.

### City Detail
This page looks similar to the homepage where the top shows the same type of weather information but specific to the current city.

Below it an AI generated weather report is show. It is generated on four different times of the day: Morning, Midday, Evening and Night. Depending on the time period you get a different report. Since it's AI generated, every day and every time of the day will get a unique report.
