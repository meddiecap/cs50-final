# 3-Minute Walkthrough: A Different Weather Report

Welcome to "A Different Weather Report"—a weather website that’s as creative as it is informative. Let’s take a quick tour of what you’ll experience as a user.

## Homepage Experience

When you first land on the homepage, you’re greeted by a clean, modern interface. At the top, you’ll see a navigation bar with links to the homepage, login, register, and logout (if you’re logged in).

If the site can detect your location, you’ll also see a card showing the weather for your current city, along with a 24-hour hourly forecast presented in a slick, swipeable carousel. This makes it easy to get a sense of how the weather will change throughout the day, hour by hour.

 The main content area features a list of 10 major cities from around the world, each displaying the current weather conditions—temperature, wind, humidity, and a weather icon for quick reference. 

## City Page Experience

Clicking on any city takes you to that city’s dedicated page. Here, you’ll see a detailed current weather card, a 24-hour forecast carousel, and—if you’re logged in—a set of tabs at the top. The first tab always shows the default weather report for the city, generated by an AI and formatted for easy reading. The other tabs represent the creative styles available. For these, you’ll see a button to generate a report in that style. When you click it, the site fetches a fresh, AI-generated report tailored to the city, the weather, and the style you chose.

If you’re not logged in, you’ll only see the default report. But once you log in, the full creative power of the site is unlocked, letting you explore weather reports as a pirate, a fashionista, a noir detective, or even in the voice of Shakespeare.

## Logged-In Extras

Logging in gives you access to all report styles for every city. Each report you generate is cached in the database, so if you or another user requests the same report again, it loads instantly. Your session is managed securely, and you’ll see flash messages for actions like login, logout, and registration.

## Dynamic Weather Reports: Time of Day

One of the most unique features of the site is how the AI-generated weather reports change based on the time of day. In the morning, the report starts with a headline and a TLDR summary—a quick list of what to expect in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Each period then gets its own section with a header and a detailed paragraph. In the afternoon, the report includes a "Summary So Far"—recapping the day’s weather up to that point—followed by detailed sections for the afternoon and evening. In the evening, the report focuses on what’s left of the day and the coming night. This structure ensures that the report is always relevant, concise, and easy to scan, no matter when you visit.

## In Summary

Whether you’re just checking the weather, looking for a creative twist, or want personalized advice, "A Different Weather Report" offers a fun, interactive, and informative experience. The site combines real-time data, AI storytelling, and user personalization to make weather reporting anything but boring.
